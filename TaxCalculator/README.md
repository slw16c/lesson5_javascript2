### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned that in the .getElementById, the E in .getElementById("taxEstimate") needs to be capitolized, because you're going to spend a couple hours trying to figure out why stuff isnt clearing. 
2. I learned the ids in the HTML are important in showing the .getElementById where it needs to be. 
3. I also learned that var means variable.
